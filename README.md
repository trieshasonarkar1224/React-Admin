Enlisted below are the things I learnt today. ðŸ‘‡
<br>



âœ® Introduction to React Admin and its key features.



The video aims to provide an updated crash course on React Admin, a tool for creating admin panels. It will involve creating a blog admin area using JSON server as a backend.

<br>
React Admin is an open-source front-end framework for creating data-driven applications, offering UI components based on Material Design. It adapts to projects of all sizes and offers a low learning curve.

<br>
React Admin is backend agnostic, working with any API using a data provider object to fetch data. Various predefined data providers are available, or you can create your own.

<br>
Basic building blocks of React Admin include the resource component, which defines CRUD routes and views like list, create, edit, and show.
<br>

<br>


âœ® Setting up the development environment.

<br>


<br>
The project will use JSON Placeholder for backend data, simulating CRUD functionality without real database persistence.

<br>
Setting up the environment involves running npm init react-admin, choosing a data provider, and starting the server. The project structure includes React and TypeScript configurations.

<br>
React Admin's main component is the admin component, which requires a layout and data provider. The app's structure is similar to a typical React SPA.
<br>


<br>


âœ® Creating resources and implementing CRUD functionalities.

<br>

<br>
Adding a resource for posts, which includes views for listing, creating, editing, and showing records. The list view includes pagination and export options.

<br>
React Admin's high-level functionality simplifies displaying API data with features like pagination and mode toggling.

<br>
Customizing the data grid and displaying extracted text using function fields. Adding styles using the SX prop for individual components.

<br>
Implementing expandable rows in the data grid to show additional content using the useRecordContext hook.
<br>

<br>

âœ® Enhancing the application with additional resources and views.

<br>

<br>
Adding users as a new resource and creating a list view for users similar to posts. Implementing show views for both posts and users.

<br>
Creating edit and create views for posts, allowing changes to the user, title, and body fields. Implementing edit buttons in the list view.

<br>
Implementing search and filter functionalities in the post list view using text and reference inputs.

<br>
Customizing icons for resources and implementing a custom homepage for the admin panel.

<br>

<br>


âœ® Implementing authentication.

<br>


<br>
Creating a simple authentication provider with hardcoded credentials for demonstration purposes.

<br>
Implementing login, logout, and error checking functions, utilizing local storage for user sessions.

<br>
The authentication system checks permissions and roles, though in the demo, it resolves all requests.

<br>
Concluding the video with a summary of the React Admin features and a reference to code availability for further learning.
